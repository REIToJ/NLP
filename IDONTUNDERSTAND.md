# NLP
First of all - I don't understand why there are some half-words like "ет, ст, де, ют, etc" in my cloud. I think the parsing part went wrong. But I don't quite sure where that "wrong" is.

Second - I don't know what to do in case of my "счастье, счастья, счастью, etc". "Счастье" and its forms are like top 5 of my words in that essey. 
I know that I need to use lemmatization but the only solution I found was something like a dictionary with pre-made lemmatization of many english words.
I haven't succeeded in finding a method to implement lemmatization for just one word. But I guess it's just my searching-skill problem.
